    <h1>Test SameSite Cookie</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a cookie is set with the SameSite=Strict attribute, browsers will not
        send it in any cross-site requests. You will not be logged in.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, if you visit the site from the top-level navigation (need to
        select the address bar and hit enter), you will see that you are logged
        in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure that you logout/login again after changing cookie parameters.
